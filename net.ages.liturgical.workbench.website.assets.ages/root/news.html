            <h5>Saturday of the Souls</h5>
            <p class="indent">The Saturday of the Souls, this year, is on Feb 14. The following two Saturdays, Feb 21
                and 28, strictly speaking are not Saturdays of Souls, according to the liturgical books, and that is why
                you won't see hymns about the deceased on those days. Feb 21 is the Saturday of Cheese Week, which each
                year is dedicated to honor the memory of the holy Ascetics. The next Saturday, this year Feb 28, is the
                Saturday of the first week of Lent, which is always dedicated to the memory of the miracle of the kolyva
                by St. Theodore.</p>
            <p class="indent">In common parish practice, after the first Saturday of the Souls (this year Feb 14), the
                next two Saturdays are thought of as also being Saturdays of Souls, and folks expect and get a memorial
                service at the end of liturgy, however inconsistent this is with the liturgical books.</p>
            <p class="indent">All that having been said, we've appended the special litany and prayer for Saturday of
                Souls to the end of the Memorial Service on the DCS. You can find it using the menu: <a
