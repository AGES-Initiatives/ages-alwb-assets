	<p>Sep 6, 2024: App users have reported that they are not getting the updates to the Services Calendar. You may need to do this manually. Open the Services Calendar index; tap the refresh button, which looks like a circular arrow. Wait a minute. This may cause the app to hang. If so, simply exit the app and relaunch it. Do this regularly to be sure you have the latest updates.<p>
