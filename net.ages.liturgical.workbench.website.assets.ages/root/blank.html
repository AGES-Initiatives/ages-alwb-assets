<p>Feast of the Forty Martyrs - March 8 this year</p>
<h5>The feast of the holy Forty Martyrs is normally celebrated on March 9. This year, March 9 is the Saturday of the Souls, and therefore, according to the typicon, the commemoration of the Forty Martyrs is moved to Friday, March 8. Because this is a minor feast on a Friday, the normal fasting rule for Friday is somewhat relaxed: wine, oil, mollusks, and crustaceans are allowed. Refrain from meat, fish, dairy, and eggs.</h5>
<hr class="dashed">
<h5><b>02-22-2024</b></h5>
<p>Saturday of the Souls</p>
<h5>The Saturday of the Souls, this year, is on March 9. The following two Saturdays, March 16 and 23, strictly speaking are not Saturdays of Souls, according to the liturgical books, and that is why you won't see hymns about the deceased on those days. March 16 is the Saturday of Cheese Week, which each year is dedicated to honor the memory of the holy Ascetics. The next Saturday, this year March 21, is the Saturday of the first week of Lent, which is always dedicated to the memory of the miracle of the kolyva by St. Theodore. It is the following three Saturdays that again are dedicated to praying for the deceased. In common parish practice, after the first Saturday of the Souls (this year March 9), the next two Saturdays are thought of as also being Saturdays of Souls, and folks expect and get a memorial service at the end of liturgy, however inconsistent this is with the liturgical books.</h5>
<h5>All that having been said, we've appended the special litany and prayer for Saturday of Souls to the end of the Memorial Service on the DCS. You can find it using the menu: <a href="https://dcs.goarch.org/goa/dcs/p/b/eu/memorial/en/bk.eu.memorial.pdf" target="_blank">Sacraments and Services > Sacraments and Blessings > Memorial</a>.</h5>
